There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Waggl, a webapp for finding your new best friend.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
This product is for anyone who is looking for a companion or an organization that is looking to find a new life for their dogs.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Many times people will turn towards breeders or puppy mill outlets when they want to get a new dog, because that is either the only method they know or it is the easiest. Well, we are looking to provide a new platform for finding your new soul-pup. This webapp aims to match rescue organizations with people looking to provide a cozy home for the dog that matches exactly what they are looking for whether it be size, breed, energy level, etc.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
There are too many wonderful dogs who get no chance at adoption. If we make it convienient and avialable for people to search for the dog that fits their lifestyle, then we can work towards homing every dog.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
Our product allows for shelter organizations to list their dogs in detail so that users can filter for the dog that they have always wanted.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
"60% of shelter dogs are euthanized every year through no fault of their own. At Waggl, we are taking action on this. Our goal is to massively reduce those numbers by bringing two worlds together; two lives that never thought they needed each other so much."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
For our adopters: After you login with your Facebook account, you will be searching for that new best friend in seconds.
For our shelters: After we verify your organization, you will be able to list your dogs within minutes hassle-free using our suggested options.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"I always wanted a German Shepherd, but most of them are too energetic. My coworker told me about Waggl.com and within 5 minutes, I found a low energy, adult German Shepherd 4 miles from me. Within the next week, I was able to bring Ace into my home, and he has been so happy and relaxed here! I have told all my friends about Waggl incase they are looking for a new dog."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
If you are looking to make a difference in the community and especially the canine community, say "No" to puppy mills and breeders, and bring a dog into your home that you know will match your personality.
